Comprehensive technical documentation for implementing production-ready vehicle systems in Unreal Engine 5.

## Available Guides

### [Chaos Tank Vehicle Implementation Guide](ChaosTankVehicleImplementationGuide.md)

A complete, step-by-step implementation guide for building skeletal mesh-based tank vehicles using Chaos Physics in Unreal Engine 5.

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Core vehicle setup (skeletal mesh, physics, Chaos configuration)
- ✅ Multiplayer replication and client prediction
- ✅ AI control systems with shared input abstraction
- ✅ Deterministic replay and recording
- ✅ DIS/HLA simulation bridge integration
- ✅ Subsystem-based damage modeling
- ✅ AI platoon behavior and formation driving
- ✅ Performance optimization and scaling

**Target Audience:**
- Unreal Engine developers implementing military/training simulations
- Technical leads designing vehicle systems
- AI programmers building coordinated multi-agent systems
- Network engineers working on distributed simulations

**Document Stats:**
- 5,025 lines of technical documentation
- 30 comprehensive sections
- Production-ready code examples (C++ and Blueprint)
- Validation checklists for each major section

## Quick Start

1. Read the [Project & Plugin Preparation](ChaosTankVehicleImplementationGuide.md#1-project--plugin-preparation) section
2. Follow sections 1-10 for basic vehicle setup
3. Add multiplayer support with sections 11-16
4. Implement AI control using sections 17-23
5. Integrate advanced systems (sections 24-30) as needed
